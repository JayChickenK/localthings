"""The sweep that drops sensor rows a platform move has superseded.

The dryer's dryLevel and dryTime became selects in #439. unique_ids are
scoped by (integration, platform), so that move cannot rewrite the old rows
-- they can only be dropped, and until they are, every upgraded dryer keeps
a permanently-unavailable `sensor.<name>_dry_level` carrying the user's
rename, area and any automation reference.

Deliberately not a numbered migration (reviewed on PR #407): the sweep is
idempotent, so a version gate would buy only running it once, at the cost of
a bump that fails the *whole entry* to load on a downgrade rather than
losing two entities.
